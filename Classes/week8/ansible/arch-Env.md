## Important Points to Remember

1. **Ansible Uses SSH Connection to Work with Remote Servers**  
    Ansible connects to remote servers using SSH, ensuring secure and seamless communication.

2. **Agentless Tool**  
    Ansible does not require any agent installation on the managed nodes, making it lightweight and easy to use.

3. **How Ansible Executes/Completes Any Operation?**  
    Ansible uses playbooks (written in YAML) to define tasks. These tasks are executed sequentially on the target machines.

4. **Ansible Follows Push Model & Agentless Architecture**  
    Ansible pushes configurations and commands from the control node to the managed nodes without requiring any pre-installed software on the target systems.
