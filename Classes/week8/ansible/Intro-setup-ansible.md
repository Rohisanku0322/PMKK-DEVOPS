# Introduction to Ansible  

## Overview  
Ansible is an open-source, command-line IT automation tool written in Python. It is widely used for automating tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and system updates.  

## Key Features of Ansible  
- **Agentless Architecture**: No need to install agents on managed nodes.  
- **Push Model**: Executes tasks by pushing configurations from a central control node.  

## Use Cases  

### 1. Configure Systems  
Ansible can be used to configure systems efficiently.  
**Examples**:  
- Create a `dbadmin` user on all servers.  
- Open specific ports on all database servers.  

### 2. Deploy Software/Applications  
Ansible simplifies software and application deployment.  
**Examples**:  
- Install the `nc` command on all servers.  
- Install and configure a web server.  

### 3. Update Systems / Apply Patches  
Ansible helps in keeping systems up-to-date by applying patches and updates.  

### 4. Provisioning  
Ansible can provision servers, although tools like Terraform are often preferred for this purpose.  

## Why Use Ansible?  
- **Configuration Management**: Ensures systems are in the desired state.  
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort and human error.  

Ansible is a powerful tool for IT automation, making it an essential part of modern DevOps practices.  

## Ways to Use Ansible  

We can use Ansible in two ways:  
1. **Ansible CLI Commands (Ad Hoc Commands)**: These are one-liner commands executed directly from the command line for quick tasks.  
2. **Ansible Playbooks**: Written in simple YAML files, playbooks allow for more complex and repeatable automation tasks.  

> **Note**: Both Ansible CLI Commands/Ad Hoc Commands and Ansible Playbooks rely on modules to perform tasks.  

## Ansible Distributions & Versions  

### Ansible and Ansible Playbooks for Automation  
Starting from version 2.10, Ansible is available in two distributions:  

1. **Ansible Core**  
    - The actual Ansible tool used to run ad hoc commands and playbooks.  
    - Comes with a minimal set of modules to work with your environment.  

2. **Ansible Community**  
    - Built on top of Ansible Core and includes community collections/modules.  
    - Allows for extended functionality by installing additional collections/modules as needed.  

### Key Points to Remember  
- You can install either Ansible Core or Ansible Community based on your project requirements.  
- Both distributions can be installed using the `pip` command.
